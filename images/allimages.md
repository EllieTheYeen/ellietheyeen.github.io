A favicon icon og:site_name 
og:title 
og:description 
It is possible to put many lines here 
in og:description by placing actual lines in the HTML document 
In fact Mastodon does the same with alt text and it works very good 
It does make the HTML look messy but it is really good for Discord 
Anyway this is some filler text that is useful to see how long descriptions are previewed
