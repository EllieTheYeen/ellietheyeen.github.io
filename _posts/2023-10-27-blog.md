title: Setting up a blog
---
This is my blog what I am going to post posts that are too long for my [Mastodon](https://toot.cat/@DPSsys) but also to be able to have a better archive of posts and better text formatting.

The posts will mostly be technical things about projects and I am going to make some tools to make it easier to post.

It will be fun to make some tools such as one to make posts here automatically go to social medias and also one to make posting of images easier. I will ofc publish those tools as soon as I make them. There are for example probably some tools to make previews more detailed on social media.

Later I might create a second blog for my art or something like that if I decide to continue with it but there are quite some art projects I want to do.

There are still some quirks to work out like how to make it easier to post certain things especially pictures as EXIF data needs to be stripped and such. There is a plugin for jekyll called jekyll-feed so you can subscribe to this blog with [RSS](/feed.xml). *Mweeoops since I am a yeen deer*
