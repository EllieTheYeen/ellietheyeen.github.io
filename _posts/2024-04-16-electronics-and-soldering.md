Decided to get into electronics more lately so decided to do some soldering of several microprocessor boards and also got a new camera setup to allow of making videos and streams about electronics. Currently waiting for a delivery of some PCBs I made in Kicad and Fritzing which will hopefully arrive soon. Here are some videos of me soldering.

An Arduino Nano that arrived in the mail today. There is a [a post](https://toot.cat/@DPSsys/112278064096595965) about what arrived in the mail today.

Lolin mini is a small ARM based board that is quite small as the name suggests.

A Raspberry Pi Pico is not like the other Raspberry Pi to say as it runs quite different software and acts more like an Arduino.

Hope you had fun watching these if you did.
