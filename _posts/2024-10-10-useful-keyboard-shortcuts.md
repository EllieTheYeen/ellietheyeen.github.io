There are a lot of useful keyboard shortcuts in a large amount of applications and operating systems that make using those a lot easier and faster. You should always look up the keyboard shortcuts for the applications you use to be able them better. Here are some various examples from apps I commonly use.

## Windows

### Ctrl + Shift + ESC
This will bring up the task manager directly which is incredibly useful.

### Ctrl + ESC
This will bring up the start menu which is good when you have a non working windows key such as when you have removed it for gaming purposes.

### Win + Shift + S
This will bring up a menu where you take a screenshot just by clicking on a window and you can also select other modes using the menu that pops up.

### Win + Alt + PrintScreen
This will use Windows Game Bar to take a screenshot which is good for games that are not on Steam therefore does not have any `F12` screenshot key.

### Win + G
This will bring up Windows gamebar where you can do things like record video of games, adjust volume controls or take screenshots.

### Alt + PrintScreen
This will take the current window and take a screenshot of it and place in clipboard. I useed to use this a lot before I knew of other methods and had a special [tool](https://randomness.nu/ClipImage.jar) that I ran afterwards to save the image. Then I made [an even better tool](https://kserver.nu/tools/clipthing.php) for it. Keep in mind if Dropbox is installed it tends to use this shortcut to save a screenshot to Dropbox.

### Alt + Space
This will bring up a menu for the current window where you can for example maximize or minimize or even move it. This is very good when windows get stuck in weird positions.

## Text editors

### Ctrl + Up or Down key
This will scroll up and down without moving the cursor

### Ctrl + Left or Right key
Skip a whole word forwards or backwards in a text document. You can also hold down `shift` to select at the same time

### Tab when text is selected
This will indent the lines where the text is selected one step and you can use `shift` also at the same time to unindent instead.

## Firefox

### Shift + ESC
This will bring up the task manager for firefox which can be very 

### Space bar
Just pressing space bar without anything selected will scroll down. If you use `shift` at the same time you will scroll up instead.

### Ctrl + Tab
This will switch to the next tab and holding `shift` at the same time will go to the previous.

### Ctrl + 1-9
Will switch to the tab with that position.

### Ctrl + Shift + s
Open a special take screenshot menu with built in cropping.

Firefox [has a large amount of shortcuts](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/keyboard_shortcuts/index.html) in general which are good to know
